# Telemetry Stream Deck Plugin
This plugin uses the telemetry interface of TML-Studios games Fernbus Simulator, Tourist Bus Simulator and The Bus to control ingame-functions.

## Install the latest version:

1. Download the current release [here](https://github.com/tml-studios/telemetry-stream-deck-plugin/releases/tag/1.0.9).
2. Open it, and the stream-deck software will start the automatic install.


## Connecting to a Game
1. Make sure to enable the Telemetry setting and restart the game.
2. In the StreamDeck software, buid your desired Layout and klick on one of the actions.
3. Youll find two fields in the settings of each action: Target IP (default: 127.0.0.1) and Target Port (default: 37337).
4. If the game and StreamDeck software are not running on the same Computer, you need to set the IP of the Computer running the Game as the Target IP.
