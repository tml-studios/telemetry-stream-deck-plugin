# Telemetry Stream Deck Plugin v2

> **Note:** This plugin has been completely remade. Not all features from previous versions are currently implemented.

This plugin uses the telemetry interface of TML-Studios games—**Fernbus Simulator**, **Tourist Bus Simulator**, and **The Bus**—to control in-game functions via an Elgato Stream Deck.

---

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/tml-studios/telemetry-stream-deck-plugin/releases/tag/2.0.1).
2. Open the downloaded file. The Stream Deck software will automatically start the installation process.

---

## Connecting to a Game

1. Enable the **Telemetry** setting in the game and restart it.
2. Open the Stream Deck software, create your desired layout, and add one of the plugin actions.
3. Each action provides two configuration fields:
   - **Target IP** (default: `127.0.0.1`)
   - **Target Port** (default: `37337`)
4. If the game and Stream Deck software are running on different computers, set the **Target IP** to the IP address of the computer running the game.
